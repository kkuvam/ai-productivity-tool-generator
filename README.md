# AI Productivity Tool Generator

This is a simple but powerful AI-based app that helps you turn natural language ideas into working productivity tools like planners, trackers, and dashboards. You just describe what you want, and it generates full Streamlit code instantly.

## What It Does

You can write a prompt like “a habit tracker with checkboxes and a progress chart,” and the app will:
- Understand your description
- Generate a full working tool using Python + Streamlit
- Let you preview it instantly
- Give you the option to download and reuse the code

There's also a template library to help you get started faster.
